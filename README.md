# Shape-Function-Free-PS-FEM
This paper proposes a shape-function-free smoothed finite element method (PS-FEM) on arbitrary polygonal and polyhedral meshes. The model achieves accurate, stable computation on irregular, concave, and nonconforming meshes without requiring explicit shape functions and element mappings.
